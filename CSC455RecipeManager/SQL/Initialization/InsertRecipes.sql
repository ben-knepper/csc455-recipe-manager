	"Mix together the orange juice, lemon juice, lime juice, salt, black pepper, thyme, garlic, ginger, habanero pepper, curry powder, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a bowl. Whisk in the vegetable oil. Pour 3/4 of the marinade into a resealable plastic zipper bag, and place the chicken wing pieces into the bag. Squeeze out any air, and mix the wing pieces with the marinade, and refrigerate from 4 to 12 hours. Place the remaining 1/4 of the marinade in a small bowl, and refrigerate until grilling time.                            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.                            Remove the wing pieces from the bag of marinade, and discard the used marinade. Sprinkle the wings with salt and pepper to taste, and sear on the hottest part of the grill until the wings begin to brown, about 4 minutes per side.                            Move the wings to a less-hot part of the grill, baste with the unused portion of the marinade, and close the grill. Grill until the wings are golden brown, show good grill marks, are no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 more minutes. Baste again with marinade and turn after 5 to 8 minutes.                                                Kitchen-Friendly View",

	"Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        For the turkey: Four days before service, place the salt, sage, thyme, black peppercorns, and allspice into a spice grinder and pulse until the peppercorns and allspice are coarsely ground, 5 to 6 pulses. Set aside.Set the turkey, breast-side down, on a large cutting board with the tail closest to you. Use an electric knife or heavy-duty kitchen shears to cut up one side of the backbone. Turn the bird around and cut back down the other side of the spine. Reserve the backbone for Giblet Stock. Discard any fat pockets or excess skin found inside the turkey. Turn the turkey breast-side up and use the heel of your hands to press down on both breasts, until you hear a cracking sound and the bird has flattened slightly.Rub the seasoned salt on both sides of the turkey. Place the turkey on a parchment paper lined half sheet pan, breast-side up with legs running with the long side of the pan. Store, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 4 days.Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and leave at room temperature for 1 hour.For the panzanella: Place the parsnips and rutabaga in a large nonstick roasting pan, toss with vegetable oil and set aside.Place one rack in the middle of the oven and a second one far enough below so the roasting pan will fit. Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.Place the turkey directly on the middle rack of the oven with the legs perpendicular to the metal bars of the rack. Place the roasting pan with the parsnips and rutabaga on the rack below the turkey and roast both for 30 minutes.Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Add the red onion to the roasting vegetables and stir to combine. Continue to roast both the vegetables and the turkey until a probe thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155 degrees F, an additional 40 to 50 minutes.Remove the turkey from the oven onto a cooling rack set inside a half sheet pan and rest for 30 minutes.Add the Brussels sprouts, bread cubes and garlic to the roasting vegetables, stir to combine and roast for an additional 15 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the oven and immediately transfer to a serving bowl. Pour the apple cider vinegar in the warm roasting pan, stir and scrape off any browned bits from the pan. Pour the vinegar mixture over the salad, add the thyme and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper as desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.Carve the turkey with an electric knife and serve with the panzanella.

	"Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander until the water runs clear. Combine the rice with water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low; cover and simmer until rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Spread cooked rice onto a baking sheet to cool. Season with 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and salt.                            While the rice is simmering, pour the eggs into a skillet over medium-high heat and allow to cook without stirring or turning to get a flat layer of cooked egg. When egg is completely cooked, remove from skillet and set aside on a cutting board to cool.                            Separate the nori sheets onto a flat surface and divide the cooled rice between them, leaving only a half-inch strip of seaweed visible at the top of each sheet. Arrange strips of egg, cucumber, carrot, cheese, and ham in thin layers on top of the rice. Beginning with the bottom of each sheet of nori, use a bamboo sushi mat to firmly roll each piece into a cylindrical shape. Brush each roll with 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil and cut into six even pieces.                                                Kitchen-Friendly View",

Bring to a boil and add the eggplant. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the eggplant in a colander, reserving 1 to 2 cups of the cooking liquid separately. Allow eggplant to continue to drain while you proceed.Return the same Dutch oven to the heat and add the olive oil. When hot, add the onion, bell pepper and celery and cook, stirring, until very soft, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic, ground beef and tasso and cook, stirring to break up the meat, until the meat is brown, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste, Essence, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and cayenne pepper and cook for 2 minutes, stirring. Add the reserved eggplant, ham, and 1 cup of the reserved eggplant cooking liquid and stir gently to combine. Cook for 5 minutes. The mixture should be moist but not soupy. If it seems too dry, add a bit more of the reserved cooking liquid. In a small bowl combine the heavy cream, eggs, and green onions and add to the eggplant, along with 3/4 cup of the bread crumbs. Stir gently to combine.Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch casserole and sprinkle with the remaining bread crumbs. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until bubbly around the edges and lightly golden on top.Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.Emeril's ESSENCE Creole Seasoning (also referred to as Bayou Blast):                                                            Combine all ingredients thoroughly.Yield: 2/3 cupRecipe from \"New New Orleans Cooking\", by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie TirschPublished by William Morrow, 1993.

	"Lightly spoon flours into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine water and potato in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook for 15 minutes or until tender. Place mixture in a blender; process until smooth. Reserve 1 1/2 cups potato liquid; discard the remaining potato liquid. Cool the potato liquid to warm (100 to 110). Combine 1 cup bread flour, potato liquid, and yeast in a large bowl. Cover and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.Add whole-wheat flour, honey, oil, and salt to yeast mixture. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes); add enough of remaining bread flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent the dough from sticking to hands (the dough will feel tacky). Place dough into a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise 30 minutes or until doubled in size. (Press two fingers into dough. If indentation remains, the dough has risen enough.)Preheat oven to 375.Uncover dough; brush egg white over loaf. Sprinkle dough with pumpkin seed and sunflower-seed kernels. Bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack.",

	"Preparation                                        For topping:                Blend sugar,cocoa powder, and cinnamon in small bowl.                                                            For filling:                Whisk sugar, flour, and espresso powder in heavy medium saucepan to blend. Gradually add milk, whisking until smooth. Whisk in yolks and salt. Add butter. Cook over medium-high heat until pastry cream thickens and boils, whisking constantly, about 6 minutes. Whisk in vanilla. Transfer to small bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of filling. Chill until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.                                                            For doughnuts:                Combine yeast and 1/4 teaspoon sugar in large bowl of heavy-duty mixer. Pour warm milk over and stir to blend. Let stand until yeast dissolves and mixture bubbles, about 10 minutes.                                                                Meanwhile, whisk flour, cinnamon, salt, and 1/4 cup sugar in medium bowl to blend. Whisk butter and eggs in another medium bowl to blend.                                                                Butter large bowl. Using dough-hook attachment, beat butter-egg mixture into yeast mixture on medium-low speed until well blended, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl, about 4 minutes. Beat in flour mixture by 1/4 cupfuls, then beat dough until smooth and beginning to pull away from sides of bowl, about 5 minutes. Scrape dough from hook into bowl. Let dough rest 5 minutes. Scrape dough into buttered bowl (dough will be sticky). Turn dough to coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough overnight.Sprinkle 2 baking sheets lightly with flour. Gently press dough to deflate. Roll out chilled dough on lightly floured surface to 1/3-inch thickness. Using 2 3/4- to 3-inch-diameter round cutter, cut out dough rounds. Transfer rounds to floured sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Gather dough scraps. Roll out to 1/3-inch thickness; cut out more rounds. Repeat until all dough is used. Cover dough rounds on sheets with towels. Let rise in draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.                                                                Line 2 baking sheets with several layers of paper towels. Pour oil into large deep skillet to depth of 1 1/2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 360°F to 370°F. Fry 3 dough rounds at a time until golden brown, adjusting heat to maintain temperature, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Using slotted spoon, transfer doughnuts to paper towels to drain. Dip both sides of warm doughnuts into topping. Transfer to rack and cool completely.                                                                Spoon filling into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain round tip. Push blade of small sharp knife into side of 1 doughnut about 3/4 of the way to opposite side; remove knife. Insert tip of pastry bag into slit and press in filling until center of doughnut bulges. Return doughnut to rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. (Doughnuts can be filled up to 2 hours before serving.Let stand at room temperature.)",

	"Heat the oven to 350°F and arrange a rack in the middle. Generously coat the wells of a 12-well muffin pan with butter; set aside.    Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and the measured butter in a medium frying pan over medium heat until the oil is shimmering and the butter has melted.    Add the diced onion and cook, stirring rarely, until it is a deep golden brown, adjusting the heat as necessary if it starts to brown too much, about 30 minutes. Season well with salt and pepper, add the thyme, and stir to combine. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl.    Meanwhile, clean, trim, and slice the mushrooms 1/2 inch thick; set aside. Crumble the goat cheese into pea-sized pieces and set aside.    Return the frying pan to medium heat, add the remaining tablespoon of oil, and heat until shimmering. Add the sliced mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring rarely, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add to the bowl with the onion. Add the goat cheese to the bowl and stir to evenly combine; set aside.    Place the eggs and milk in a large bowl and whisk until the eggs are broken up and evenly combined with the milk, about 1 minute. Add the measured salt and whisk to combine.    Divide the onion-mushroom-cheese mixture evenly among the wells of the prepared muffin pan. Fill each well almost to the top with the egg mixture.    Bake until each frittata is puffed and the center is just set, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan to a wire rack until it’s cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes (the frittatas will deflate). Run a small knife around the perimeter of each well to loosen and remove the frittatas. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.                                                    2012 Ree Drummond, All Rights Reserved                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Peach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Dessert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Cobbler                                                                                                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Main Ingredient</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/p/peach-cobbler-recipes.html\">Peach</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Course</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/a/apple-strudel-recipes.html\">Dessert</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/c/cobbler.html\">Cobbler</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Technique</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/b/baking.html\">Baking</a></li>                                 </ul></div>",

Whisk to combine, then stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and simmer for 45 minutes, until the sauce is thick and pourable and the flavors have melded. Strain out the solids.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Rub the steak with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill or broil the steaks, turning once, for 7-10 minutes for medium rare, depending on thickness.  Allow to rest for at least 5 minutes, then slice across the grain. Serve with the sauce on the side, or spoon it over.",

Microwave on high until edges of potatoes begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes, shaking bowl (without removing plastic) to redistribute potatoes halfway through cooking.  Alternatively, do not chop them and boil for 8 to 10 minutes, drain, and chop once cool enough to handle.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 10 or 12-inch skillet over medium heat.

Transfer to small bowl.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Melt remaining tablespoon of butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes and pack down with spatula. Cook, without moving, until underside of potatoes is brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn potatoes, pack down again, and continue to cook until well browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring potatoes every few minutes, until crusty and golden on all sides, 9 to 12 minutes. Stir in onion, seasonings of your choice and salt and pepper to taste.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            When potatoes are about ten minutes off, bring a small pot of water to boil, and add the vinegar.  Turn the heat down to a very gentle simmer and slide the eggs into the water (I use a ladle technique).  Guide the eggs back into a compact shape if needed.  Cook just until the whites are completely set, 3-5 minutes                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Taste the home fries for seasoning, and dust with almost all the paprika.

Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes until cold to stop the cooking process.

	"Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        Preheat the grill to high.In a large, nonreactive bowl, combine the lemongrass, ginger, garlic, scallion greens, soy sauce, sesame oil, and honey and whisk well. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.Skewer the shrimp, scallion whites, and red bell peppers onto skewers in whatever order you like. There should be 4 to 6 shrimp per skewer.Place the skewers on a flat plate and drizzle with peanut oil. It is not necessary to salt the skewers because soy sauce has so much salt in it. Place the shrimp skewers on the grill and cook about 3 minutes per side, or just until the shrimp curls, turns red and does not appear clear at all. Be careful not to overcook.Place the whole radicchio leaves around the edge of a platter. Mound the chiffonade radicchio and watercress inside the leaves and around the platter. Remove the skewers from the grill and place on the bed of greens. Squeeze the juice of a lime over the shrimp.*Cook's Note: if using wooden skewers, be sure to soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before placing on the grill.
