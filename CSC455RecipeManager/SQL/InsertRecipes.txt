	"Mix the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of a standing mixer with a paddle attachment or use a large bowl and a hand mixer.Separate the egg and add the egg yolk to the batter.Set aside the egg white. You will use it later to brush the tops of the cookies before baking them.Add 2 Tablespoons of water to the batter also and mix to combine.Add the flour and mix until all the flour is incorporated.Place the cookie dough on some parchment paper and form it into the shape of a disc. Wrap it up in the parchment paper and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. You can keep it in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for up to a month.Meanwhile, make the apple filling. Peel and chop the apples. Add the apples and the sugar to a skillet. Bring to a boil on medium high heat.Reduce to a simmer, and cook, covered, for about 10 minutes, until the apples are soft.Take off the heat and add the lemon juice and vanilla. You can also add some cinnamon. Cool.Store the apple filling in the refrigerator. If you want to make a large batch to have on hand, sterilize the glass jar and lid, add the filling to the jar, seal with the lids and place the jar with the apple filling in a pot with boiling water, covering the jars by at least 1 inch. Cook for 10 minutes. Lift the jars out of the pot and cool.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.When the cookie dough is stiff, roll out half of it on a well floured surface. Use a cookie or biscuit cutter or even an inverted cup/glass and press out as many circles as you can. My biscuit cutter was 3 inches, but you can make the circles even bigger, if you want.Take all the extra dough, scrunch it up and place in the refrigerator to chill while you are making the cookies. I usually place it in the freezer, so it chills faster. Just don't forget about it:). You can use every last scrap of dough for cookies, and that's a good thing.Place about a heaping teaspoon or so of filling in the center of the circles. Fold the circle over the filling, pinch the seams closed with your fingers and then use a fork to make sure the cookies are sealed well. Make sure there are no air pockets in the cookies, or they might burst as they bake.Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet.Use a fork to whisk up the egg white that you set aside earlier when making the dough. If you made the dough ahead of time and didn't save the egg white, just use a whole egg, whisk it up with a fork. No big deal. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg white on top of the cookies. Sprinkle sugar on top of the cookies.Bake in the preheated oven for 22-30 minutes, depending on how thin you rolled out the dough and how big you made your cookies. The cookies should be lightly golden.Repeat with the remaining cookie dough and the cookie dough scraps.",

Combine vinegar and next 4 ingredients (through rind) in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 6 minutes or until thick and syrupy. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange tofu slices in pan in a single layer; saut 5 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Remove from heat; pour vinegar mixture over tofu to coat. Sprinkle with green onions and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.Wine note: Tofu works with just about every wine, but given the flavors of soy sauce, orange, and sesame, a refreshing white is in order. In particular, sesame and orange both work magnificently with unoaked chardonnay. My favorite: St. Supery Oak Free Chardonnay from Napa Valley, California. The 2008 is $25. Karen MacNeil",

With a sharp knife, cut a thin slice from bottom of watermelon so it lies flat.                                                                                            Using a small sharp knife, lightly score a horizontal cutting line around middle of the melon, leaving 4 in. on each side of stem end unscored for the head. Next, score a vertical line over top of melon, connecting both ends of the horizontal line. Using a long knife, cut through melon along the vertical cutting line. (Stop cutting at the horizontal cutting line.) Then, cut through the melon along the horizontal cutting line. Gently pull off cut section.                                                                                            For turkey's head, cut a 2 in. half-circle at top. Make a scalloped edge, using the rounded edge of a 1-in. circle cutter. With a sharp knife, cut along the scalloped lines; discard scrapes. For eyes, insert a clove into the center of each of two cantaloupe balls. Using toothpicks, attach eyes; add a chili pepper wattle.                                                                                           With a vegetable peeler, cut peel from oranges. (Save oranges for another use). Thread grapes, orange peel and remaining cantaloupe balls onto skewers; add to turkey for feathers.                                        Yield: 9 servings.                                                                                                     TIP: Once guests each have a skewer, you can slice and serve the remaining watermelon.

Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the liquid. Sprinkle the sugar over the top and let sit without stirring, until foamy, about 5 minutes.Add the flour and mix with the paddle at medium speed to make a moist dough. Add the eggs, mixing until combined, 2 minutes. Increase speed to high and beat thoroughly for 2 minutes. Stop and scrape down the bowl; add the orange zest and salt. Gradually add the butter while mixing, then beat on high speed to make a stretchy, tacky batter, about 3 minutes.Generously butter and flour an 8-inch ring mold. Scoop batter into the mold and smooth over the top with a spatula. Cover loosely with plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray and set aside in a warm place until batter rises about 3/4 up the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.Bake the savarin until golden brown, and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool savarin in the pan until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Flip onto a rack to cool.Meanwhile make the syrup. Put the water and sugar in a medium sauce pan. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds; add both vanilla seeds and pod to the pan. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and add wine and orange liqueur.Place savarin in a lipped serving platter and pour the warm syrup over the top. Turn the savarin over a few times until fully saturated with syrup. Cover and refrigerate for an hour. Spoon the syrup over the cake a couple times while it chills to fully soak the cake.When ready to serve if there is more than a pool of syrup on the platter, pour the excess into a bowl or pitcher and serve on the side. Spoon whipped cream into the middle of the savarin, and top with desired fruit. Serve.Cook's Note: Savarin and syrup can be made up to three days ahead. Soak savarin the day it is served. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to overnight, or freeze for 2 weeks.

	"Adjust the oven racks to the upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spread the tortilla wedges on 2 rimmed baking sheets. Lightly coat both sides of the tortilla with vegetable oil spray.                            Bake the tortilla wedges until they are lightly browned and begin to crisp, 8 to 12 minutes.  Flip the tortilla wedges and continue to bake until the chips are fully toasted, 8 to 12 minutes longer.  Set the tortilla wedges aside and turn the oven to 500 degrees.                            Combine the poblano chiles, 1 cup of the onions, Melt®, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a 12-inch skillet. Cover and cook over medium-low heat until the vegetables are softened, 8 to 10 minutes.  Uncover, increase the heat to medium-high, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes longer.                            Stir in 2 tablespoons of the cilantro, garlic, and chipotles and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and the broth. Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels and season with 1/8 teaspoon pepper.  Nestle the chicken breasts into the sauce and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, about 5 minutes.  When the sauce simmers, flip the chicken, cover, and continue to cook until the chicken registers 160 to 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 10 to 12 minutes longer.                            Transfer the chicken to a plate. When cool enough to handle, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Process the sauce in a blender until completely smooth, about 1 minute.  Return the sauce to the skillet, season with salt and pepper to taste, bring to a simmer over medium heat.                            Stir in the tortillas and cook until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the shredded chicken, then transfer the mixture to an 8-inch square baking dish.  Sprinkle with the cheese and bake on the lower-middle rack until hot throughout, 5 to 10 minutes.                                                Kitchen-Friendly View",

	"Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        Wash the chicken under cool running water and pat it dry with paper towels. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 12 hours and as long as 2 days.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Oil a roasting or baking pan with canola oil.Make the stuffing: Put the breadcrumbs in a medium bowl. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the liver and gizzard with salt and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the skillet and when it melts, add the giblets and cook quickly until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer them to a cutting board, chop finely and add to the breadcrumbs. Off of the heat, add the wine and scrape the bottom of the skillet to dislodge the brown bits; pour the liquid onto the breadcrumbs and mix.Add the pork to the skillet and cook until browned, about 5 minutes; scrape the pork into the bowl with the bread mixture. Add 3 tablespoons of the butter, the onions and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the onions are soft and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the sage and garlic and cook 1 minute longer. Add the Swiss chard and cook until wilted. Scrape the mixture and all the buttery juices onto the breadcrumbs and mix to combine. Add the chives and lemon zest and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed.Loosen the skin over the chicken breasts. Insert the remaining 4 tablespoons cold butter under the skin of the chicken breasts, pushing down to disperse them. Rub the chicken all over with a thin film of canola oil. Sprinkle the chicken heavily on all sides with 3/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with the bread mixture, and stuff the neck skin with any remaining stuffing. Set the bird in the oiled roasting pan.Roast the chicken until the skin dries and the butter melts, about 15 minutes. Turn the heat down to 375 degrees F and continue to roast, basting the chicken once or twice with the fat that accumulates in the corners of the pan, until the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 55 minutes.Transfer the chicken to a large platter to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Strain the pan juices into a bowl and skim off the fat. Pour 1/4 cup water into the roasting pan, set it on a burner on high heat and scrape up any stuck-on bits on the bottom with a rubber spatula. Return the defatted juices to the pan and simmer together for 3 to 5 minutes to make a thin, natural gravy. Season with salt and pepper.Carve the chicken on the platter. Slice the wings at the joint, twist to remove them and set them above the chicken. Cut the thighs at the joint, twist to remove them, slice them diagonally at the leg joint to separate them into thigh and drumstick and lay them on the platter. Carve thin slices from the breast meat and let them lay as they fall; pour a little gravy over the white meat, avoiding wetting the crispy skin of the thighs. Cut the stuffed neck in slices, and serve with the rest of the gravy in a small pitcher on the side.

Let sit at room temperature while you prepare the salad to allow the flavors to meld.Rinse the quinoa in a strainer until the water runs clear. Combine the quinoa, 2 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small saucepan, bring to a boil and cook until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes.Transfer to a bowl, fluff with a fork and let sit for 5 minutes to cool slightly. Add the tomatoes, olives, green onions, cherry peppers, red onions, cucumbers and dressing and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours before serving.

Let the mixture cool for about 5 minutes. Add the eggs, one by one, stirring just until mixed, then stir in the coffee and the teaspoon of vanilla. Stir in the salt and when well mixed, stir in the flour. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.Bake at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool until they are just slightly warm. However, while the brownies are still hot, put a few teaspoons of peanut butter on top and let it soften from the heat. When the brownies have cooled slightly but are still warm, spread the softened peanut butter in a very thin layer. This is to help the second layer stick better.Mix peanut butter and 2 tablespoons butter. Add sifted powdered sugar and vanilla; mix until it’s smooth. It will be thick and dough-like. Feel free to add more peanut butter if desired. Place mixture between 2 sheets of parchment, wax paper or foil and press into an 8 inch square.Lift the slightly warm brownies from the pan by grasping foil. Peel foil/parchment away from one side of the peanut butter and turn it onto the brownies. Pull off the other piece of paper. Let cool.Melt chocolate in the microwave using 50% power and spread over top. Allow the chocolate to set, but before it gets very firm, go ahead and score it. Chill until firm, about one hour.

	"Directions                                                        Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.Unroll the crust on a lightly floured work surface. Using floured fingertips, seal any tears in the dough. Sprinkle the dough very lightly with flour. Using the bottom paper to lift, turn the dough over into 9-inch-diameter ceramic or glass pie dish. Peel off the remaining sheet of paper. Trim the dough overhang to 3/4 inch. Fold the overhang under and form a smooth top edge. Crimp the edge decoratively. Pierce the bottom and sides of the crust all over with a fork. Chill the crust at least 10 minutes.Bake the crust until deep golden around the top edge and light golden on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F.Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta cook until brown and crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain and cool, reserving the pancetta drippings in the skillet.Add the zucchini, shallots and garlic to the skillet. Saute over medium heat until the zucchini is just barely tender, tossing occasionally, 5 to 6 minutes. Cool the zucchini slightly, about 10 minutes.In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and cream. Add the cheese, basil, cooled pancetta, mustard, salt, pepper, nutmeg and cooled zucchini mixture. Whisk to blend. Pour the custard into the cooled pie crust.Bake the quiche until the sides are slightly puffed and brown and the center is set, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on a rack 20 to 30 minutes, and then serve warm or let cool completely and serve at room temperature.

	"1.In a food processor, pulse the whole-wheat and all-purpose flours with ½ teaspoon of salt.  In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks, water and the 1 teaspoon of oil.  With the processor on, add the egg yolk mixture and process until a ball forms.  Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until smooth.  Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.  Wipe out the processor.  2.In a small skillet, toss the pine nuts over moderate heat until toasted, 1 minute; let cool.  In the food processor, pulse the arugula, pine nuts, cheese, garlic and the remaining 1/3 cup of oil to a paste.  Season the pesto with salt and add to a large skillet.  3.Cut the dough into 3 pieces; work with 1 piece at a time and keep the rest covered.  Flatten the dough slightly and run it through progressively narrower settings in a pasta machine until you reach the thinnest setting.  Cut the pasta into 10-inch lengths.  Using the pasta machine, cut each length into fettuccine.  Transfer to a baking sheet, leaving space between the pasta so it doesn’t stick.  4.In a pot of boiling, salted water, cook the pasta, stirring, until al dente, about 30 seconds.  Drain the pasta, reserving 1/3 cup of the cooking water.  Stir the reserved water into the pesto.  Add the pasta and tomatoes to the pesto, toss over moderate heat and serve.",

Cool in pan 10 minutes on a cake rack, turn out and cool completely.Ganache: In a small saucepan bring cream to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate. Let cool, stirring occasionally, until thickened, but still pourable.Assembly: Halve cake crosswise. On a cake rack set over a baking sheet, cover bottom cake layer with raspberry jam and replace top layer. Over center of cake pour ganache and smooth over top and sides with a palette knife until evenly coated. Let icing set, about 1 hour. To decorate, pipe whipped cream as desired, arrange raspberries and mint and dust with powdered sugar.

Place 1 slice in each well of a 12-well muffin pan, pressing the prosciutto evenly into the bottom and up the sides of each well; set aside. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small frying pan over medium heat until foaming. Add the panko and cook, stirring occasionally, until light golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.While the pasta is draining, rinse the saucepan and wipe it dry. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the saucepan over medium-low heat until foaming. Add the flour and whisk until smooth. Cook, whisking occasionally, until the flour has darkened slightly in color, about 2 to 3 minutes.Add the milk very slowly, whisking it into the flour-butter mixture. Continue cooking, whisking constantly to smooth out any lumps, until the mixture simmers and thickens, about 6 to 7 minutes.Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the reserved pasta water, cheeses, mustard, measured salt, and pepper and whisk until the cheese has melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the drained pasta and stir to combine.Divide the pasta mixture among the wells of the prepared muffin pan and sprinkle with the toasted panko. Cook until the edges of the mac ’n’ cheese cups are bubbling slightly and the tops are light golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.Remove the muffin pan to a wire rack and let it cool for 5 minutes.

Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.For the burgers:Place all of the ingredients except the chicken and oil in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the ground chicken and mix with your hands until just evenly combined.Divide the meat mixture into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into an even 1/2-inch-thick patty, wetting your hands with water as needed if the mixture is sticky. Transfer the patties to a baking sheet and refrigerate while you prepare the grill.Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to medium high (about 375°F to 425°F). When the grill is ready, use tongs to rub the grate with several layers of paper towels dipped in vegetable oil.Using a flat spatula, transfer the reserved patties to the grill, close the grill, and cook undisturbed (do not press down on the patties) until grill marks appear on the bottom, about 3 to 4 minutes. Using a clean spatula, flip the patties, close the grill, and cook until the patties are cooked through and the juices run clear, about 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove to a clean plate and let rest in a warm place or tent loosely with foil for 5 minutes.To assemble:Spread about 1 tablespoon of the chile mayonnaise on each top and bottom roll (2 tablespoons per sandwich). Place 2 of the chicken patties side by side on each bottom roll. Divide the cilantro leaves, pickled carrots, and romaine lettuce evenly among the sandwiches and cover with the top rolls.

	"1. In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and the scallion bulbs and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the collard greens, salt, black pepper, and cayenne and cook, stirring, until the greens wilt, about 1 minute. 2. Increase the heat to moderately high. Add the sausage, black-eyed peas, and rice and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in the broth and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, until the rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the scallion tops. Wine Recommendation: The robust flavors of Hoppin' John call for an equally assertive wine. Go for a brash, full-bodied red zinfandel from California. Its spicy blackberry richness is easily up to the task.Notes: Collard greens braised to melting softness in the Southern style (slow-simmered with plenty of pork) are truly delicious, but the greens don't actually have to cook for hours. In twenty minutes they'll be just tender.",

Drizzle the chocolate syrup into a glass. Pour the milk into the glass and fill with seltzer. A siphon bottle for dispensing seltzer works best. If a siphon bottle is not available, add seltzer to milk while stirring with a long narrow spoon rapidly, slowing as the glass fills. This action to the seltzer will create the foam "head" you need for a great egg cream.Chefs Note: The glass is a KEY part to the "ideal" Egg Cream. Utilize a SODA glass (like a Coca-Cola glass) that is narrow on the bottom and flares out on the top.

	"Peel half the carrots and chop them, transfer to a bowl. Chop half the celery and both onions, add to the bowl along with the carrots. Sprinkle the chicken thighs with 1 teaspoon salt. Heat a large stockpot over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add half the chicken, skin side down and cook 3 to 4 minutes, turning once or twice until the chicken is well browned. Transfer to a plate. Add another tablespoon of olive oil and the remaining chicken thighs. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, until the chicken skin browns. Transfer to the plate with the other chicken thighs. Add the vegetables and brown, cooking 3 to 4 minutes more. Return the chicken thighs to the stockpot along with their juices.Cover with the chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. When the broth comes to a boil, cover and reduce to a simmer. Cook 20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through to the bone. Transfer the chicken to a plate to cool 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the skin and discard. Shred the chicken and return one cup of it to the broth with the veggies. Reserve the remaining chicken for the other three recipes. Discard the bones. Serve the soup immediately. Allow the reserved chicken to cool completely before storing it in an air-tight container for the remaining recipes. Cool leftover soup completely before storing refrigerated, in an air-tight container for another meal.Chicken SaladChop one cup of the reserved chicken meat and add to a large bowl. Chop the remaining celery and add it to the bowl along with 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, 1/2 teaspoon garlic or onion powder. Mix well and serve or refrigerate, in an air-tight container, until ready to use. Use this tasty chicken salad with any leftovers you might have in your fridge like cucumber wedges, whole grain bread, or serve over whatever salad greens you have on hand. If you happen to have plain yogurt on hand you can switch up the recipe to 1/4 cup plain yogurt mixed with 1/4 cup mayonnaise.Chicken thigh meat (minus the skin), makes the richest, moistest chicken salad and its far more economical compared to drier chicken breast especially if you go for organic chicken. If you cant or dont want to do mayo, drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil and add a teaspoon of mustard. Add a handful of fresh herbs if you have them or a tablespoon of the jarred salsa for extra flavor.Chicken TacosCoat a baking tray or toaster oven tray with cooking spray. Chop one cup of the reserved chicken meat and divide it between 6 taco shells. Sprinkle a tablespoon of the grated cheese inside each shell and transfer to the prepare baking sheet. Bake 8 to 10 minutes until the cheese is melted and the shells are crisp. Add 1 cup of thinly sliced kale or other salad greens that you have on hand. Top each with 1 tablespoon of the salsa and serve immediately. To pack these tacos to go, pack the salsa separately and allow them to cool before storing in an air-tight container.Massaged Kale Salad with Shredded ChickenI get a lot of complaints that kale is tough, but in this recipe I share the secret to making kale tender and delicious. Tenderizing kale is two-fold process, massaging it first with the oil of your choice and letting it rest in the fridge over night. So prep ahead and make this recipe the night before you plan to eat it. I recommend curly kale for kale beginners since it has a mild taste and is easy to find in any grocery store. Kale is not only super inexpensive and filling but its the most nutritious plant around  making it a top superfood any way you slice it. To make it into a tasty salad follow the instructions below.Rough chop the kale and place it in a large bowl along with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Squeeze the kale with your hand, while rubbing the olive oil into the leaves. If you have dried fruit on hand, add 2 tablespoons (such as raisins, dried cherries, or apricots). Add chopped veggies lingering in your crisper. Cover and refrigerate over night. Top with the remaining chicken and any other add-ins you have from your pantry like nuts, crumbled cheese, thinly sliced fresh fruit like apples or pears, or skip the fruit completely and use up the leftover salsa and toss in some leftover cheddar cheese from your grocery list.Looking for more ways to get healthy meals, fast?

Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.                                                                2. To make the meat loaf: In a large bowl, combine the turkey, bread crumbs, onions, carrot, milk, tomato sauce, egg, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix gently but thoroughly. Mound the meat loaf mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, patting it into a loaf shape with your hands.                                                                3. To make the topping: In a small bowl, combine the ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard. Spoon the topping over the meat loaf, using the back of the spoon to spread it evenly.                                                                4. Bake the meat loaf for about 45 minutes, or until the meat is no longer pink on the inside and is cooked through (165°F on an instant-read thermometer). Let it sit for 5 minutes, then slice and serve.                                                Hands On            My Mama always says that the best kitchen tools you have are the ones God gave you, and they're right on the ends of your arms! When you really need to get in there and get a good vigorous mix going, use a nice clean pair of hands. That's my advice for mixing up this meat loaf. It's faster and more efficient, not to mention kind of fun.                                                         2 g fat, 216 calories, 32 g protein, 15 g carbohydrate, 2 g fiber, 775 mg sodium                            Nutritional analysis provided by                                        Other                                                                                                Reprinted with permission from From Mama's Table to Mine by Bobby Deen, © 2013 by Bobby Deen Enterprises, LLCBorn in Georgia BOBBY DEEN is the son of famous Food Network host and bestselling cookbook author Paula Deen, as well as the host of his own show, the Cooking Channel's Not My Mama's Meals.
